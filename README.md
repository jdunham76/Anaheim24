GSA Connects Anaheim 2024 Roberts Mountains Allochthon Origin.

Roberts Mountains Allochthon Presentation at GSA Connects Anaheim 2024. Click on the pdf file name, a preview will appear, click on the arrow icon at the upper right to download the file. This is a pdf file that reduces file size from the original Powerpoint format. Notes below the figures describe each slide. I have to use Portrait Orientation to display the notes. You can adjust the pdf page width to 150% to view figures and notes without all the blank space at the bottom of the page. The reference list is an Excel spreadsheet organized by slide number. Click the Raw Button to download the Excel file.
